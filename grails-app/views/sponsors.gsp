        <h1>Gr8Ladies appreciates all sponsors!</h1>

        <p>To keep going, Gr8Ladies will need continued support from everyone!</p>

        <p>For events, there are food costs, event spaces, catering, and other vendors.
        Providing these items at your organization can be a great way to reduce cost and get free or low cost publicity.</p>

        <p>There are many different ways to provide support
        and sponsorship without directly giving money.  Gr8Ladies can always use web hosting, email hosting, technical support,
        office supplies, and printing.</p></p>

        <p>Retweets and promoting events is another great way to become a media sponsor.</p>

        <h2>What do sponsors get?</h2>

        <p>In addition to eternal gratitude, sponsors are recognized in a variety of ways.</p>

        <p>Sponsors are featured in public announcements, twitter, handouts, and acknowledged in person during events.
        If a representative of the sponsor is present, he or she can speak about the sponsoring organization including any
        open jobs or information about the company they would like to give.</p>

        <p>Continued and sustaining supporters can get images and promotional spots on the Gr8Ladies website.
        Please email sponsors@gr8ladies.org for more information and a member of the gr8ladies team will respond from their person address until an email host is found.</p>
